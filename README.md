# VIP Project: Music & Technology

This project explores the intersection of music and technology to create innovative experiences and solutions. In this project, we'll be using a Jupyter Notebook for interactive development.

To be able to run the code make sure you have the following Python dependencies installed:

- **jupyter** - for running and interacting with your notebook.
- **numpy** - for numerical computations.
- **pandas** - for data manipulation.
- **matplotlib** - for data visualization.
- **torch** - for machine learning and tensor computations
- **pydub** - to extract mp3 and music samples

you can also run thi command to install all the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install jupyter numpy pandas matplotlib torch pydub librosa
```
